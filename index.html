        <p>Hi! I'm Mishka Sophia Dahunan. Here's my story.</p>
        <p>I was born on June 12, 2008, in the City of Golden Friendship — Cagayan de Oro City. Growing up, life had its bright days, but also its dark seasons. It wasn’t always easy, and that's something I'm not afraid to admit.</p>
        <p>During the pandemic, I went through a tough time. I felt lost, disconnected, disappointed, and deeply sad. It was a quiet kind of sadness — the kind you carry in silence. I didn’t know how to express it, and for a while, I just kept it all inside. But through that experience, I started to slowly understand myself more.</p>
        <p>Growing up, I’ve always been curious and creative in the smallest ways. I love exploring new things, expressing myself through art and crafts, and finding joy in simple moments. One of the biggest things that shaped me is crocheting — it’s not just a hobby, it’s how I relax, express myself, and make thoughtful gifts for others.</p>
        <p>I'm also someone who values peace and kindness. I prefer calm environments, but I also enjoy deep conversations, fun bonding moments, and learning about different people and perspectives. Whether it’s through school, my interests, or everyday life, I always try to be genuine and mindful.</p>
        <p>As a student, I do my best to stay focused and motivated. As I was once a disappointment, I believe in working hard — but also in taking care of my mental health and knowing when to rest. Life isn’t perfect, but every day is a chance to grow and become a better version of myself.</p>

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crocheting</strong> – It's my safe space. I love making little plushies, accessories, and gifts. Each project feels like a quiet reminder that something beautiful can come out of patience and care.</li>
            <li><strong>Watching movies and series</strong> – I enjoy stories that make me think or feel deeply. Whether it's a drama, mystery, or slice-of-life, movies help me escape and reflect at the same time.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploring tech</strong> – I like discovering how apps work, understanding gadgets, and learning little things about coding. It fascinates me how something digital can be built with logic and creativity.</li>
            <li><strong>Journaling</strong> – Writing my thoughts down helps me cope, reflect, and stay grounded. It's like talking to myself without judgment.</li>
            <li><strong>Listening to music</strong> – Music helps me express feelings I can’t put into words. My playlists are full of emotional, chill, and meaningful songs that keep me company during both happy and sad moments.</li>
            <li><strong>Learning new skills</strong> – Whether it's drawing, editing, or trying digital art, I enjoy experimenting and picking up small creative hobbies.</li>
            <li><strong>Spending time alone</strong> – I value solitude. Quiet moments help me recharge and reconnect with myself.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonding with people I trust</strong> – I'm quiet around many, but when I'm with people I feel safe with, I enjoy laughing, sharing stories, and making memories.</li>
            <li><strong>Taking photos</strong> – I like capturing moments that feel meaningful, even the little things. Whether it’s nature, random objects, or candid selfies, photography helps me see beauty in the ordinary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Travels</h2>
        <p>I love visiting new places, even if it's just somewhere simple or close by. My favorite trip so far has been to <strong>Bukidnon</strong>. It wasn’t super fancy or anything, but the view was amazing and the air felt so fresh — it gave me peace.</p>
        <p>We stayed near the mountains, and I still remember how cold the morning was and how quiet everything felt. It’s those simple moments I enjoyed the most. I took a lot of pictures, but some of the best memories are the ones I didn’t capture with a camera.</p>
        <p>I don’t get to travel often, but when I do, I like just being present — no pressure, no rush, just enjoying what’s around me. Someday, I hope to visit Baguio or even outside the country, but for now, I’m happy with small trips that make me feel alive and calm.</p>

            <h3>How I Started Crocheting</h3>
            <p>It all began when there was a free dental service in <strong>Calaanan or Camaman-an</strong> during the pandemic. I was bored and honestly just looking for anything to keep my mind off things. I noticed a group of elderly women doing something interesting, so I decided to take a look.</p>
            <p>They were kind and very willing to teach. I decided to give it a try. At first, I didn’t know how to do anything, but as I watched and listened to how they taught me — with patience and kindness — I gave my best.</p>
            <p>My first few attempts were a mess — uneven stitches, tangles, and a lot of frustration. But for some reason, I didn’t give up. I kept practicing, and slowly, my hands got used to the rhythm. I looked down and realized I had actually made something... something small, but mine.</p>
            <p>Since then, crocheting has become more than just a hobby. It's my way of expressing myself and coping with stress. Each plushie or piece I finish makes me feel calm, proud, and even a little healed. It's quiet, but it means a lot to me.</p>

      <p>I’m Kate Hanalou S. Dabuet. I was born on September 20, 2008, in Tocdog, Loay, Bohol. We are four siblings in the family, and I’m the second child—and the only girl among us. Ever since I was a kid, my parents have already separated. When they parted ways, we went with our mother and moved to Cagayan to live there.</p>
    <p>I was still young back then, so I didn’t really understand what was happening at the time. After five years, my mom met someone who would become like a father to us—and that person is my uncle, who is now our stepfather. Life may be very different from what we were used to, and it may not be the same as before, but we had no choice but to accept it.</p>
